Load balancing techniques:

    Round-Robin DNS-> asign one request to a server at a time

Sticky sessions:

    All requests from the same client always goes to the same backend server

perform server health check:

    incase of unhealthy server laodbalance does not send to sam server for requests

Access location and post to loadbalance:(Closes geographical load balancer)

    GeoDns
    
    GeoIP

CDNs (Content Delivery Networks):

    make up a network of physical hosts that are geographically located as close to the end users as possible

#### Change management:

Run tests:

    Unit test

    Integration test

Continous Integration (CI):

    Build and test our code everytime there is a change

Open source SI:

    Jenkins:

    Travis CI - by Github

Deploy changes:

    CD - Continous Deployment

    Build artifacts

Environmrnt:

    anything needed to run a service

        Test environment

        Production environment

A/B testing:

    some request are served using one set of code and configuration (A) and other requests are served using a different set of code and configuration B

#### Understanding Limitations

Rate Limits:

    revent one service from overloading the entire system

Utilization limit:

    Cap the total amount of a certain resource that you can provision

Use beta test to avoid system crash

### Monitoring and Alerting

Monitoring:

    Looking into the history and current status of a system

Monitoring systems:

    AWS CloudWatch
    
    Google Stack Driver

    Azure Metrics

Those that can be used across vendors

    prometheus

    DataDog

    Nagios

Pull model:

    monitoring infrastructure periodically queriesour service to get metric

Push model:

    our services needs to periodically connect to the system to send metrics

whitebox monitoring:

    collecting metrics from insdie a system like how much storage space the system is running and 
    how long it takes to process a request

    checks behaviour of a system from inside

blackbox monitoring:

    checks the behaviour of our system from outside


#### Getting notification alerts:

run job automation and  send status of a system:

    Linux --> cron

alert raising:

    pages:->those that need imeadiate attention
    
    non-urgent -> configured to create bugs/tickets for IT specialist
