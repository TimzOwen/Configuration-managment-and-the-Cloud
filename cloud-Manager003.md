Capacity:

    How much the service can deliver

QPS:

    server reponse in one second to certain number of queiries 

scaling:

    Horizontally --> adding morenodes to the main server

    Vertically --> Making nodes bigger (CPU, Memory, Disk space)

    Automatically -->uses metrics to automatically increase/decrease the capacity of a system

    Manually--changes controlled by humans instead of software

#### Evaluating the Cloud

security certificate:

    SOC
    
    ISO 27001

Choose the right service to be offered to by the cloud  provider

PaaS: give ofer management of an application to the cloud provider

web application platform:

    Amazon Elastic BeanStalk

    Microsoft App Service

    Google App Engiene

Containers:

    Applications that are packaged together with their configurations and dependecies

Clouds:

    public clouds -- >services provided to you by third-party

    hybrid clouds--> both private and public

    Multi-clouds -- Mixture of public and/or private clouds across venders
